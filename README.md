## My process

- Wrote the HTML part
- Gave it CSS styling
- Wrote JS file 
- Changed HTML & CSS part after watching a YT video

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- I learned a new and effective way of writing CSS
- I learned how to make perfect choices in terms of your arrangement of the HTML tags to make it    easier to style and work

### Continued development

I would love to challenge myself and try to find answers like this project made me do. I had to start looking for an answer cause I couldn't reflect the functionalty on all 4 list elements which is when I stumbled across edsHTML who came in clutch help me fix my minor CSS issues and JS file.
